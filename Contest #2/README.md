## Problems

### [A. Assem's Secret Code](https://codeforces.com/gym/586622/problem/A)
<details>
<summary><strong>Problem Summary</strong></summary>

- **Focus:** String Manipulation  
- **Description:**  
  Assem has a secret code `s`, a three-letter word hidden in plain sight. Your task is to determine if this word, regardless of capitalization, spells out "YES". For example, "yES", "Yes", or "yes" are all valid.  

- **Input:**  
  - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10<sup>3</sup>) â€” the number of test cases.  
  - Each test case consists of a string `s` of three characters. Each character is either an uppercase or lowercase English letter.  

- **Output:**  
  - For each test case, output "YES" if `s` can be transformed into "YES" by adjusting the case of its letters. Otherwise, output "NO".  
  - The output is case-insensitive (e.g., "yES", "yes", and "Yes" are all valid positive responses).  

- **Examples:**  
  | Input | Output |  
  |-------|--------|  
  | `10`<br>`YES`<br>`yES`<br>`yes`<br>`Yes`<br>`YeS`<br>`Noo`<br>`orZ`<br>`yEz`<br>`Yas`<br>`XES` | `YES`<br>`YES`<br>`YES`<br>`YES`<br>`YES`<br>`NO`<br>`NO`<br>`NO`<br>`NO`<br>`NO` |  

- **Note:**  
  The first five test cases contain strings like "YES", "yES", "yes", "Yes", and "YeS". All of these are valid because they can be transformed into "YES" by adjusting the case of their letters.
